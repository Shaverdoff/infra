```
Aerospike NOT A QUARUM DATABASE
ITS DISTRIBUTED DB

NO MASTER OR SLAVE

if you have 3 replicas - its 3 copy of DATA!
if you lose 1 of 3 nodes, you dont lose perfomance.
SNAPSHOT VERY QUICKLY

minimum SSD, better IN MEMORY
 EASY SCALE!
 MINIMUM LATENCY
 SCALE HORIZONTALLY with SSD OR NODES

VS CASSANDRA
need less servers then for cassandra
better perfomance
